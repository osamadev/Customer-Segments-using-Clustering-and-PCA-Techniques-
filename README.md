## Creating Customer Segments for a Wholesale Distributor using Clustering and PCA Techniques (Unsupervised Learning)

Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms (K-Means and GMM) both empirically and theoretically, then compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.
For dimensionality reduction, I applied the principal components analysis (PCA) to define the most important features that drive the trend in the dataset (have the maximum variance). 
For clustering the dataset, I have used Gaussian Mixture Model (Expectation Maximization algorithm).

## Visualizing a Biplot
A biplot is a scatterplot that can help us interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships between the principal components and original features.
